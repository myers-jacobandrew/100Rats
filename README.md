Project Overview

100Rats is a comprehensive tool designed specifically for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons. It aims to streamline the process of managing player characters, creating encounters, and simulating combat scenarios to enhance the gaming experience for dungeon masters.

The project encompasses several key objectives aimed at creating a robust and user-friendly tool for tabletop role-playing enthusiasts. These objectives include:

1. Player Character Management

Develop a system for managing player characters (PCs), including attributes, abilities, equipment, and combat actions. This system provides players and dungeon masters with a centralized platform to track and manage PC data efficiently.

2. Monster Database Integration

Integrate a comprehensive database of monsters and NPCs to provide a diverse range of adversaries for encounters. Utilize this data for simulations, calculations, and encounter building. (Implementation awaiting encounter builder, battlefield manager, spell/ability parser, and player character parser)

3. Combat Simulation

Implement algorithms to simulate combat scenarios based on player and monster attributes. This includes handling initiative, actions, movement, and special abilities to accurately depict combat dynamics in the game world.

4. Encounter Builder

Create an intuitive interface for building custom encounters. Dungeon masters can select monsters from the integrated database, adjust environmental factors, and set difficulty levels to tailor encounters to their players' preferences.

5. AI Opponent Strategies

Develop AI algorithms to determine optimal strategies for monsters during combat simulations. The AI considers various factors such as tactics, target selection, and resource management to provide challenging and engaging encounters.

6. Visualization Tools

Provide graphical representations of combat scenarios, including battle maps, character tokens, and dynamic animations. These visual aids enhance immersion and assist players and dungeon masters in tactical planning and decision-making.

7. Encounter Analysis

Generate reports and visualizations to analyze encounter difficulty, balance, and outcomes. Dungeon masters can use these insights to adjust encounters for optimal gameplay and challenge levels.
8. User-Friendly Interface

Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for players and dungeon masters. The interface facilitates navigation, encounter creation, and result interpretation, ensuring a seamless user experience.
9. Customization and Extensibility

Allow users to customize rules, import custom monsters and characters, and extend functionality through plugins and modular components. This flexibility enables users to tailor the tool to their specific gaming preferences and needs.
10. Documentation and Tutorials

Provide comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples to guide users in utilizing the combat simulator effectively. These resources empower users to maximize the tool's potential for their RPG sessions and campaigns.
